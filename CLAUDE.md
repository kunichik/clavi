# Clavi — Project Specification for Claude Code

## What is Clavi

Clavi (`clavi.dev`) is a cross-platform automatic keyboard layout switcher and language bridge tool.
The name comes from Latin `clavis` = key/keyboard.

**Core problem:** People who write in multiple languages (e.g. Ukrainian + English) constantly
switch keyboard layouts manually — or worse, type entire words in the wrong layout and have to
retype. On top of that, Ukrainian diaspora abroad often lacks a Ukrainian keyboard layout entirely
and resorts to phonetic transliteration like "pryvit" instead of "привіт".

**Clavi solves this automatically, silently, cross-platform.**

---

## Hard Rules — Never Violate

1. **Russian language is permanently banned.** No Russian keyboard map, no Russian dictionary,
   no Russian in any language pack. This is hardcoded in core, not a config option. Any
   `pack_loader` must reject locale `"ru"` unconditionally.
2. **No telemetry, no cloud.** Keystrokes never leave the machine.
   **Sync account is optional.** If the user opts in, settings are synced via E2E-encrypted
   cloud (zero-knowledge). Default: local-only. Account has no access to typed content —
   only config (language packs, theme, exclusions).
3. **Privacy first.** Keystrokes never leave the machine. No logging of typed content.

---

## License

**GPLv3** — strong copyleft ensures forks stay open. Language packs (`packs/`) are licensed
separately under **CC BY-SA 4.0** so communities can contribute dictionaries without touching
the core codebase license.

## Detection Algorithm (3 Layers)

### Layer 1 — Deterministic (~80% of cases, <1ms)

1. Remap typed word through each layout map
2. Dictionary lookup: if remapped form exists and typed form doesn't → switch

**Ambiguous words:** if typed exists in BOTH dicts → `NoAction`. Never guess.
**Short words:** never act on ≤2 chars.

### Layer 2 — Statistical (~15% of cases, 1–3ms)

Character n-gram model (3–5 grams). Ukrainian has highly distinctive sequences:
`ий`, `ть`, `нн`, `щ`, `ї`, `є`, `ґ`. Confidence threshold: 0.75.

### Layer 3 — LLM context (~5% of cases, 20–80ms)

`llama.cpp` with Qwen2-0.5B (q4_K_M, ~400MB). Lazy-loaded on first use.
Timeout: 150ms. Runs in separate thread via `std::future`.

---

## Binary File Formats

### `dictionary.bin`
Magic `CLAV`, entry count, flat open-addressing hash table of xxh3_64 hashes. Load factor ≤ 0.7.

### `keyboard_map.bin`
Magic `KMAP`, entry count, pairs of `[4-byte source codepoint][4-byte target codepoint]`. Sorted for binary search.

### `ngram.bin`
Magic `NGRM`, ngram count, ngram size, then `[N bytes UTF-8 ngram][4-byte float log-probability]`.

---

## Thread Model (Desktop)

```
Hook Thread (libuiohook) → lock-free ring buffer → Main Thread (Layer 1+2) → LLM Thread (Layer 3)
```

- Hook thread: pushes `KeyEvent` into SPSC ring buffer (256 capacity).
- Main thread: detection pipeline + IPC socket server.
- LLM thread: lazy-started, communicates via `std::promise`/`std::future`.

---

## UX Principles — Critical, Never Compromise

1. **Always show before acting.** Toast: `"Switched to Укр → [undo]"` for 3 seconds.
2. **Undo stack is mandatory from day one.** Last 10 actions, one hotkey to revert.
3. **Never switch on short words (≤2 chars).** Too many false positives.
4. **Exclusion list.** Per-word, per-app opt-out via `exclusions.toml`.
5. **Fix, don't rewrite.** Text improvement must preserve the user's voice and style.

|-----------------|---------|------------------------------------|
| Layer 1 latency | < 1ms   | Dictionary lookup + remap          |

## Language Pack Format

```toml
# packs/{locale}/pack.toml
[pack]
locale = "uk"
name = "Ukrainian"
version = "1.0.0"

[features]
switch = true
translit = true
bridge = true

[files]
keyboard_map = "keyboard_map.bin"
dictionary = "dictionary.bin"
ngram = "ngram.bin"
translit = "translit.toml"
```

`pack_loader.cpp` must hardcode: `static constexpr std::array<std::string_view, 1> BLOCKED_LOCALES = {"ru"};`

## Mobile — Architecture Notes

### Android IME (Kotlin, no NDK for MVP)

On mobile, Clavi **is** the keyboard — there is no "wrong layout" detection because
the user explicitly chose the keyboard. The main value props shift to:

1. **Translit / bridge mode** — type Latin phonetically → get Ukrainian Cyrillic. Killer feature
   for diaspora who lack a Ukrainian hardware keyboard.
2. **Smart diacritics** — languages like Portuguese, German, Norwegian, French require
   letters with diacritics (ã, ü, ø, é). Standard keyboards require long-press which
   interrupts typing flow. Clavi shows a context strip above the keyboard with the most
   likely diacritic variant based on the current word.
3. **Clipboard history** — both Android and iOS hide clipboard history. Clavi exposes it
   as a scrollable strip above the keyboard. Solves the "shake to undo" problem on iOS
   and the hidden clipboard on Android.
4. **Text fix** — lightweight local spell-check that fixes obvious errors without
   rewriting the user's voice or style. Think autocorrect done right, not Grammarly.

**What does NOT apply on mobile:**
- Auto-detection of wrong layout (not applicable — user chose the keyboard)
- System tray icon
- Ctrl+Z undo (replaced by clipboard history + undo strip)

### Key design principle: Speed over features

Grammarly is heavy (40MB+, cloud, subscription). Clavi must be:
- APK < 5MB
- Cold start < 300ms
- No internet required
- No accounts

### Smart Diacritics (v0.3)

Languages with heavy diacritics use:
- Portuguese: ã, â, á, à, é, ê, í, ó, ô, õ, ú, ç
- German: ä, ö, ü, ß
- Norwegian: æ, ø, å
- French: é, è, ê, ë, à, â, ç, î, ï, ô, ù, û
- Guatemalan Spanish (es_GT): same as ES but local vocabulary

Implementation: When user types a base letter in a configured language, the suggestions
strip above the keyboard shows diacritic variants ordered by word-frequency in the
dictionary. Tap once — no long-press needed.

### Local Market Packs

Pack system (same format as desktop `packs/{locale}/pack.toml`) extended to:
- `es` — Spanish
- `es_GT` — Guatemalan Spanish (local toponyms, vocabulary)
- `quc` — K'iche' Maya (20M speakers, no good keyboard exists)
- `pt_BR` — Brazilian Portuguese
- `de` — German
- `no` — Norwegian

Each pack ships: dictionary, keyboard layout, translit rules (if applicable),
diacritics frequency table (new field for mobile).

---

## CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

### `ci.yml` — build + test on every push/PR

Matrix: `ubuntu-24.04`, `macos-14`, `windows-2022` × `Debug`/`Release`.
Steps: checkout with submodules → install deps → cmake preset → build → ctest → clang-tidy/format.

### `release.yml` — on tag `v*`

CPack artifacts: `.deb`, `.rpm`, `.pkg`, `.msi`. Upload to GitHub Releases.

### `fuzz.yml` — weekly cron

Linux, `-fsanitize=fuzzer,address,undefined`, 10 minutes per target.

---

## Code Style

- C++20, no exceptions in hot path (`std::expected` or error codes)
- `[[nodiscard]]` on all functions returning results
- No RTTI (`-fno-rtti`)
- All strings as `std::string_view` in hot path
- Clang-format: Google style, 100 col limit
- Kotlin: official style, `ktlint`

---

## Notes for Claude Code

- `pack_loader.cpp` must hardcode rejection of `"ru"` locale — never make it configurable.
- All config is TOML — no YAML anywhere.
- Ukrainian keyboard map reference: https://kbdlayout.info/kbdur1
- For ambiguous words (in both dicts) → always `NoAction`.
- Toast content: `"Clavi: switched to {locale_name} → [Ctrl+Z to undo]"`.
- Android clipboard API: use `ClipboardManager` + `OnPrimaryClipChangedListener`.
  On Android 10+ clipboard reads are restricted outside of focus — the IME has special
  access via `InputMethodService` context, use it.
- Text fix principle: **fix, don't rewrite**. Correct obvious typos and spelling errors.
  Never change word choice, sentence structure, tone, or style. If unsure → don't fix.
- Smart diacritics: sort variants by frequency in the language pack dictionary, not
  alphabetically. Most common variant should be first (leftmost) in the strip.
